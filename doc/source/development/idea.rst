Setting up Cassandra in IntelliJ IDEA
=====================================

`IntelliJ IDEA <https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/>`_ by JetBrains is one of the most popular IDEs for Cassandra and Java development in general. The Community Edition is provided as a free download with all features needed to get started developing Cassandra.

Setup Cassandra as a Project (C* 2.1 and newer)
-----------------------------------------------

Since 2.1.5, there is a new ant target generate-idea-files. Please see our `wiki <https://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/RunningCassandraInIDEA>`_ for instructions for older Cassandra versions.

Requirements: Java 8 (C* 2.x must be compatible with Java 7), `Apache Ant <http://ant.apache.org/>`_ and `Git <http://git-scm.com/>`_

1. Clone Cassandra from Apache's Git repository

   For latest development trunk branch
   ``git clone git://git.apache.org/cassandra.git``

   For other branches (e.g. cassandra-3.0)
   ``git clone â€“b cassandra-3.0 git://git.apache.org/cassandra.git``

2. Once git has finished cloning the repository, generate the IDEA files using ant
   ``ant generate-idea-files``

3. Start IDEA

4. Open the IDEA project from the checked out Cassandra directory using the menu item Open in IDEA's File menu

The project generated by the ant task generate-idea-files contains nearly everything you need to debug Cassandra and execute unit tests.

 * Run/debug defaults for JUnit
 * Run/debug configuration for Cassandra daemon
 * License header for Java source files
 * Cassandra code style
 * Inspections
